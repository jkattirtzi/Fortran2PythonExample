# Fun with Fortran

I love Python but Fortran is fun too. 

Despite being a ridiculously old language, Fortran is great for simulations because it is super fast! 
Sometimes I want a sub programme to run fast but I don't want the entire code to be in Fortran. 

Now I can use F2Py! I write a small part in Fotran. Then I compile it and produce a .so file. This can be imported into python. 

Fun for all.
